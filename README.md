Income Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a person's income exceeds 50k or falls below that threshold based on various demographic and employment-related factors. The dataset used for this prediction is the Adult Census Income dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about individuals, including their age, education, occupation, and more.

This is a supervised classification problem, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome: whether the income of an individual is above or below 50k.

Dataset
The dataset, known as the Adult Census Income dataset, contains approximately 32,561 rows and 15 features. These features include:

Age: The age of the individual.
Workclass: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-Employed).
Education: Level of education attained.
Occupation: Type of occupation.
Relationship: Relationship status (e.g., Husband, Wife, Unmarried).
Race: The race of the individual.
Gender: The gender of the individual.
Hours-per-week: The number of hours worked per week.
Native Country: The individual's country of origin.
Income: The target variable, whether the individual's income is >50k or <=50k.
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person's income exceeds 50k based on the available features. This involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of the data, exploring relationships between features, and visualizing key patterns.
Modeling: Using various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the target variable.
Evaluation: Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
