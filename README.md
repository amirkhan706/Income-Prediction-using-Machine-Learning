💰 Income Prediction Project: Use Case Study 💰
Welcome to the Income Prediction Project repository! This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K or falls below that threshold based on various demographic and employment-related factors. Using the Adult Census Income dataset from Kaggle, we analyze the data to gain insights into income distribution across different features.

The dataset includes the following features:

👤 Age: The age of the individual.
💼 Workclass: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-Employed).
📊 fnlwgt: Final weight used to adjust for sampling in census data.
🎓 Education: Highest level of education attained.
🔢 education.num: Numerical representation of education level (0-16).
💍 Marital Status: Marital status of the individual.
👔 Occupation: The individual’s occupation.
💑 Relationship: Relationship status.
🌍 Race: Race of the individual.
👨‍👧 Sex: Gender of the individual.
